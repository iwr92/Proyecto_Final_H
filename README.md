# BarberApp 💈

## Description

"BarberApp" is an application developed as the final group project for my bootcamp at [SoyHenry](https://www.soyhenry.com/). It is designed to manage barber shop appointments and services efficiently. ✂️🗓️

I developed an application to book barbers for different services with a scheduling system and appointment management.

I also integrated a full-featured store with filters and search options.

Finally, I implemented an admin panel that allowed editing, canceling, and viewing various application metrics, among other features.
